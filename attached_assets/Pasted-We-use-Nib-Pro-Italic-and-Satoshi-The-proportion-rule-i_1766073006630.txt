We use Nib Pro Italic and Satoshi
The proportion rule is the following: The right font size for Nib Pro is determined by the formula x*0,95—where x is the size of Satoshi.

Graphics

For simple graphs with up to three values, we use primary and secondary colors, unless the graphs are related to financial data, in which case we must use only secondary colors (unless we use red to show negative performance).
We introduce our tertiary colors when graphs related to financial data have more than three values, or graphs not related with financial data have more than six values.
