You've got good access to food all around - it depends on your preference. If you want to treat yourself to an amazing meal, go to Antler Kitchen & Bar. Best restaurant in the city. Top service, informed staff, great food, and they don't skimp on the serving size.
The breakfast at the hotel is really good. If you have executive level access, I still recommend the lobby restaurant's breakfast (I forget what they're calling it nowadays. Frenchie's or something). Dinner at the hotel is good but expensive.
Activities in Toronto? Royal Ontario Museum, shopping in Eaton Center, escape rooms at Casa Loma, etc. There's a lot to do, but what is your preference?
Also - if you have time, drive over to Dimpflmeier bakery in Etobicoke (about 15/20 mins). Fresh pretzels, good coffee, and all the bread you could choose from!",2026-01-08 15:10:29 +0000 UTC

This guy has come through 3 times since then. This is my target buck for next year (assuming he sticks around). Hes a 5x5 and he’s got 1-2 stickers coming off as well (beginning of video you can see one of them on his left side on the base of the antler), how old do you think he is and what do you think he’d score? Just doing this for fun, I don’t actually care about either all that much. Hes the biggest buck over got on camera yet and I only assume he will be even bigger next year.

They have Alphys's head, Papyrus's outfit, and obviously Holiday horns. I personally believe the Knight has been stealing items from the Light World to make their costume.
In order:
Alphys's bike helmet comes from after her bike crash in chapter 1. Alphys would totally be the kind of person to have a personally fitted bike helmet, after all.
Papyrus having his battle-bod costume stolen would explain why Sans canceled the play-date in chapter 2, with Papyrus refusing to leave the house until he can make a new one.
And the horns come from a human Dess's antler headband, which she normally wore during Christmas time.",2026-01-08 12:55:00 +0000 UTC

Best way to find them is probably to just go to events. You can even try to eye accelerators (e.g. antler etc.) to ask founders there to help out. Maybe you won't work on the main product but you can always build side products to generate leads and demand.
One last thing I would say. Just make a list of 5-10 startups you would want to work for. Ask yourself: What can I build for the same ICP. Free, fun to use, easily distributed. Build that, maybe market it a little, then just go to the startup with the tool and say you built it and would love to collaborate with them.",2026-01-08 12:08:44 +0000 UTC

He LOVES antlers, out of all the things I ever got for him it’s his favorite! He’s a heavy chewer so I got them for him fairly early on from vet’s advice and it was life changing for my hands but also taught him to occupy himself without me. I get the bigger ones so there is more of the “inside” bit for him to get to and it’s softer. One antler lasts him a couple months easily and I throw it away when it gets to the point he’s almost able to fit it all in his mouth.

Second keepsake largely depends on your needs. Calling Card is fun, but if you've already filled out most of your core/desired boons (much more likely on surface than Underworld), it might not be needed. Otherwise Time Piece can be really good for starting to build up money to spend, especially on the Surface where Hermes shrines get expensive.
Third is either whatever you didn't pick in zone 2 or something more specific to your current build/situation. Experimental hammer should last you the rest of the run, Ghost Onion can help heal you up, Silver Wheel is a great boost to your magick, etc. Lots of good options. If you don't care about losing the Hades boon + the Fated Whims bonuses (which are probably mostly used up by this point), could always run Athena or another Olympian keepsake
Fourth is much of the same, only with more of a focus on beating the final boss. Moros' keepsake is probably the best if you're running Death > Strength, otherwise maybe Droplet, Hammer, or Knuckle Bones. Or you can YOLO and take White Antler, which is arguably the best keepsake... if you're good at dodging.",2026-01-07 21:23:14 +0000 UTC

^(In which Cat and Ned bongle down, Luwin has already seen eveything, and the Simpsons are going to King's Landing.)
Of all the rooms in Winterfell’s Great Keep, Catelyn’s bedchambers were the hottest.
No comment.
>The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man’s body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing.
Our first full description of Winterfell's geothermal properties. Sounds incredibly advanced - certainly hot enough to grow a lemon tree
More stuff about the Starks being cold, contrasting Dany's stuff about the blood of the dragon in her chapter:
>The Starks were made for the cold, he would tell her, and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong place.
We get just a *little* too much info about Ned and Cat's love life for my taste. Followed by Ned declaring:
>“I will refuse him,”
Proving even the most stoic man in Westeros gets post-nut clarity.
Upon the mention of Brandon, Ned laments that his late brother would have known what to do, which...uh, I'm not so sure that he would, Ned.
Cat notes that:
>the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them, as did the other, the shadow of the woman he would not name, the woman who had borne him his bastard son.
The shadow of a dead brother, and the shadow of a dead siter.
Maester Luwin then barges in and we get our first description of him, noting that:
>**His robe was grey wool, trimmed with white fur, the Stark colors**. Its great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside. Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, **toys for the children.**
Immediately painting him as a compassionate, loyal follower of the Starks. As with Cressen, this whole ""loyal to the castle, not the people"" business is clearly not followed in practice.
We're told Luwin has been left:
>a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observatory while I napped. My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king’s party.
I don't think we're ever told who in the King's party delivers this message, not that it particularly matters. Presumably some nameless Littlefinger lackey.
Inside the box:
>""A fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it. The lenscrafters of Myr are without equal.”
Ned frowned. He had little patience for this sort of thing, Catelyn knew. “A lens,” he said. “What has that to do with me?”
“I asked the same question,” Maester Luwin said. “Clearly, there was more to this than the seeming.”
Under the heavy weight of her furs, Catelyn shivered. “A lens is an instrument to help us see.”
“Indeed it is.”
Honestly, I'm with Ned on this one. This didn't really land for me, and came awfully close to something from the Adam West *Batman* series.
Cat then freaks out at the sight of the Arryn seal:
>“There is grief in this message, Ned. I can feel it.”
A reasonable assumption, but in her tone and wording Catelyn comes across as almost superstitious, sensing bad portents in the letter (similar to her earlier ruminations on the dead direwolf and the stag antler).
Upon reading the letter, Catelyn immediately lights a fire and burns it, not caring that she is stark naked. Ned, acting as the reader's stand-in, tries to shake some sense into her:
>Ned crossed the room, took her by the arm, and pulled her to her feet. He held her there, his face inches from her. “My lady, tell me! What was this message?” Catelyn stiffened in his grasp. “A warning,” she said softly. “If we have the wits to hear.”
And again, not quite my tempo, it's just a hair too melodramatic.
With Cat’s cryptic clues out of the way, we learn that Lysa believes the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn. Cat and Luwin immediately think Ned should solve this murder mystery, but Ned has other thoughts:
>“The only truths I know are here. The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.”
However, he realizes the position he’s in and agrees to go, instructing Cat to stay North with Robb, much to her chagrin.
We get our first:
>There must always be a Stark in Winterfell
Which *A Search of Ice and Fire* tells me only occurs twice in the entire series?? There must be an alternate phrasing I'm missing, because the amount of theories I've seen about what happens when there isn't a Stark in Winterfell is truly mind-boggling for a turn of phrase only ever uttered twice?
We then see some shameless favoritism from Catelyn
>Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya needed refinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never Bran.
An argument ensues over what is to be done with Jon, leading to our first discussion of his parentage. Contrary to Tyrion’s suggestion that his mother was ""some woman,"" it seems there is more to the story:
>They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys’s Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur’s sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting **violet eyes.**
So Ned apparently straight up kills the deadliest knight in the realm  - scary.
Equaly scary is his reaction to rumours of Jon's parantage:
>That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. “Never ask me about Jon,” he said, cold as ice. “He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady.” She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and Ashara Dayne’s name was never heard in Winterfell again.
Cat then notes:
>Whoever Jon’s mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely.
Hmm.
Luwin then sugests Jon be sent away to the wall, and Cat's internal monologe is basically screaming for joy.
Ned thinks on it - though not for very long, before agreeing.
We end on:
>Summer will end soon enough, and childhood as well. When the time comes, I will tell him myself.”
The weakest chapter so far, I think. Though there are some good breadcrumbs of backstory. As with *Catelyn I*, I don’t think her voice is given as much a chance to shine as it will in later chapters.

I actually prefer Rudy Knight! (though I don't believe the latter is likely unfortunately)
2. the internet being out is definitely not a major plot point. I searched the text dump and there isn't a single mention of the outage (or internet in general!) outside of chapter 2. it seems to be solely a plot point for Queen, the internet may still be down but it isn't a plot point anymore. not to mention Kris' phone works in all chapters, and Toriel can be called in two of them. Surely Kris, and especially Toriel and Asgore, would have Asriel's phone number and can just call him (doesn't require internet). Alphys saying they can't stay up late to talk to Asriel could just imply that they usually use their computer to talk to him with video (which would require internet)
I think it's also worth to say that the point I originally wanted to make was not that you're stupid for believing Asriel Knight or that it is inherently a bad theory. I just wanted to point that you saying Asriel Knight has little to no holes is false. Every theory has holes because if it didn't, it wouldn't be a theory anymore. The goal of theorycrafting is to predict how those holes might be filled by the story",2026-01-07 04:06:48 +0000 UTC

Instead of Gaster's experiment being for solely for curiosity, he is trying to create his own Angel to cross the barrier and free monsterkind (and destroy humanity), by creating a world where monster children are infused with determination instead of their parent's monster souls. When it was discovered that the first test subjects (the Holidays) had their dead father revive from his dust, the plan expanded to try to save the king's children, too, sending Asriel's dust and Chara's knife, creating Kris. However, this experiment is not the magic revival Gaster thought it was. Rudy's sickness isn't falling down, it's his Dustner turning to stone as his ""story"" in his daughter's life is coming to an end. More dangerously, the process of building this world can be repeated inside the Light World itself, creating Dark Worlds and the Roaring.
Basically, the Vessel was made out of stolen parts of the 7 fallen humans, with Chara's head used as the head as the Vessel. As the Knight doesn't have a soul, it needs to use stolen Lightner items in order to prevent it from becoming an uncontrollable Darkner when entering Dark Worlds (Dess's antler headband, Papyrus's battle bod costume, and Alphys's bike helmet).
I predict that the story going forward is redeeming the Vessel, changing it from a mere thing to Frisk, a human who embodies every type of soul, and finally becoming the Angel that Gaster wanted to create, if you do the pacifist (or genocide) route.

1) Make sure she has high initiative. If she goes first, she gets at least one turn to enjoy her 6AP. And once she is done, the enemies find her much less appealing to target since she has no AP that they can disrupt, especially if they have to move to get within range.
2) In particularly dangerous situations, use your final AP to drink an invisibility potion (or chameleon cloak scroll or cast skill; they all take 1 AP).
3) there are potions and gear that mitigate most of the negative status effects. Stone Skin and Strong Will potions are the most common. The Amulet of the Deep makes you immune to Stunned etc. Even using the bedroll before combat helps as the rested status makes you immune to knock down.
4) If you should get CC'd, have some scrolls to counter the most common CCs. Then your last character in the turn order can cure the CC. Note that if there are a number of enemy following your last character, it might be wise to delay turn to let them go first. Otherwise they might CC your glass cannon after you finish curing her.
Soul mate scroll (High Quality Tormented Soul + wheat) - Cures Frozen, Stunned, Knocked Down, Petrified
Peace of Mind scroll (Fire Essence + Crab Claw) - Cures Blinded, Sleeping, Terrified, Mad, Enraged and Charmed
Haste (Fire Essence + Claw or Antler) - Cures Crippled, Slowed
Shackles of Pain (shadow essence + skull) - cures Shackles of Pain oddly enough, or rather, transfers it to the caster
Mass Cleanse Wounds cures a lot of statuses, Necrofire, Burning, Diseased, Decayed, Acid, Poisoned, Infested, Bleeding and Suffocation but unfortunately there is no scroll version. But there is a workaround. If you are wearing a piece of armor with a rune slot, you can remove the rune and replace it with a source orb during your turn for 0 AP. You can then cast Mass Cleanse Wounds for 2AP. If you have AP remaining, you can remove the orb and replace with the original rune, again for 0 AP. It will drain a source point and you are subject to cooldown so it's not quite as good as a scroll.",2026-01-06 20:09:45 +0000 UTC

The dragon has a feline-like face with piercing glowing amber-orange eyes and antler-like branches made of dry wood and fur protruding from its head. Its body texture is incredibly detailed, appearing soft and fluffy like white wool or cloud formations. The creature is spiraling upwards over a rugged, snow-covered mountain peak in the foreground. The background features a dramatic, heavy cloudscape with a bright full moon directly behind the dragon's head creating a halo effect. In the lower distance, a warm golden sunset breaks through the deep blue and grey storm clouds, creating a stunning contrast between warm and cool lighting. Epic scale, cinematic composition, mythical creature, 8k resolution.

Sorry I did overstep that entire part. I was also kinda responding to the original post more I realized. I just love her weird ass 😭 and honestly because of how I relate to her but not in the way people assume because of how people hate her haha
So I will say again, in that context of being a teenage girl & also off topic one sec (sorry I type all over the place I get excited discussing my fav shows 😆) but part of the reason I think her loosing her baby, having to be pregnant & give birth in the wilderness; then that said still born being turned into “the wilderness” deity or whatever along with Jackie. You have another hunt & then the girl who made you jealous with your dead best friend who you were in love with was there, she’s an easy target to take out your anger on, even not during the hunt. I guess I can say I’ve not liked someone kind of like that but not entirely obviously, just related a bit to some things. Not saying ANY of it is right but I understand her reasonings unfortunately on a lot of different angles for different things.
The off topic part, I did watch my brother & his high school girlfriend get pregnant with my first nephew. He was born when I was 12. His girlfriend gave birth at 16 & yes she had some underlying factors just like everyone’s different etc. she lived with us during & after for awhile. She had very bad postpartum so I just have an enormous of amount of empathy for her for that because it does chemically & physically change you. Then yes to have a still born or in your case miscarriage, which I’m also im very sorry that happened to you & I’m sending you comfort ❤️
So Shauna doesn’t like Mari from that day on the lake when Jackie is trying to make Shauna jealous, maybe before, but that’s what it was shown clearly, to me ig. What I’m trying to say is, yes I would also be “happy” that my “enemy” was the one to draw the card & not me. I feel like “enemy” is the correct word because I feel like that’s how Shauna would see her technically since she felt she was the wedge in between Jackie & her. When it was apart of it but obviously the main wedge being Jeff, the baby, jealousy, the sleepover makeouts etc. I literally have the scene grab widgets of the hunts from s3 on the my pages on my phone(and others scenes). Lottie drawing the cards, being SOOO happy at the possibility of getting the queen when drawing the card, then the disappointed face after & then the exact one of Shauna looking at Mari with the “Tough break Mar” because it was a satisfying moment for me in TV. Haha I’m sorry not sorry. (Will include photo 🤣)

I was excited to see who pit girl was and had thought it was gonna be Mari the whole time but then when they introduced Hannah, I thought she was gonna be pit girl blah blah so it was like yes I was right! Because I enjoy horror & thrillers etc, there was a lot of hype watching it as it aired etc. that’s why I enjoy it and don’t like have a “bad” view of it. Because I know it is bad and dehumanizing & everything else but it is a horror show & they all do horrible stuff & I hope they get crazier tbh. Haha also need to see how they agree on their pact and what their pact exactly is even those we can assume the basics. Okay, got off track, back to my view on it.
Now though I said I would react the same, I wouldn’t be taking a trophy or anything like that, let’s make that clear haha I do love horror and have had a fascination with serial killers for a long time (just like every girl I know 💀🤣) so before everything in s3 with Mari & Ben (who I love Ben as much as Shauna, Lottie,Nat & Travis etc) happened she was my favorite and everyone started hating her very but I never switched up. I apologize, I’m like being light hearted & jokey this whole post and I wanted to clarify that haha Anyways my point is, if you’re in that situation, in that type of environment & “community” ; like I said I would “happy” it was my “enemy” or whatever. What I’m saying is although I get reasonings like I said, which not just her but all the characters I like analyze and read about the show a lot. If you are in the environment, and you are the “leader” “queen” etc, she was trying to get more power, which again, not right. She saw how easily Natalie was “dethroned” & at that point was probably, weirdly the only thing she “enjoyed” at that point because of how much grief & the environment, all the factors. So yeah the other girls wouldn’t have. I took the hair throphy symbolic for maybe because she didn’t take any of Jackies. Hair was common thing to take for grieving in certain religious communities to show “honor” to remember the dead & their sacrifices in the world. Like Victorian hair jewelry.
Again, not right , but the whole show is about not being right haha then when people call her a tyrant. I thought it was like a funny joke people were making 🥲 Some were actual jokes and yes she’s not a good person, like I said, it’s a show about people who aren’t good & about how they deal with how it was “just them” as adults and what did as teens. Yes I will say Shauna swayed the vote against Ben in his trial. Although, she had no interest really if was an enemy like everyone else, mainly tai and van (random side note, the two who also rigged the cards & the ones who called of the psych team for Lottie. Misty had the syringe as “backup” if they didn’t come, they didn’t & Natalie pushes Lisa out of way, when Lisa was jumping in front of Lottie) and Taissa was the who brought up how Ben didn’t help at all during her birth, which obviously triggered that. Then Lottie, so desperately looking for signs, sees the wind blow like it shows and she looks around & Travis & Akilah change their vote etc. Shauna does a lot of bad things but she’s also a product of what they made & excepted from her, so when she had “power” over all them after Lottie appointed her, she acted out of anger , and in those circumstances I could see myself doing the same thing. Again I wouldn’t take a trophy hahah but I understand weirdly why her weird ass would think she’s honoring her with her hair on the Antler Queen outfit. Since that’s what she thinks the whole “wilderness” thing Lottie “made up” is. “Honoring the people we kill / that die no matter what because we’re in the wilderness” so that’s my view of it.",2026-01-05 07:37:50 +0000 UTC

Both assist blades are trash and 2-sided ratchets just burst too much to be viable.

So 4-55, as the lowest RBT ratchet has serious use right now.
As for bits, Low Orb is a slightly off meta but extremely viable stamina but, seeing play on stationary Shark Scale builds and a few defense types but finding most use on the aforementioned Clock combo, since it's one of the lowest non-attack bits.

With smaller antler tips I use 3/8in x 3in ferro rods. Big antler pieces are taking 1/2in x 5in ferro rod. Either way they’ll basically last forever.
The rod is handset into antler, sinew bound, then sealed with pine pitch resin that I harvest and make locally here on my pine farm in East Texas. The pitch starts tacky at first and hardens with time. Smells like rich pine.
The kit also includes a ceramic arrowhead striker, pine knot and cedar hair tinder, a waxed jute twist, and a simple fire aged steel char tin with charcloth. I wrap it in muslin and twine to keep the pouch clean.
Everything lives in a heavy canvas cotton pouch. I’ve worn it to a LOTR themed wedding (ranger), Renfest as well as hiking and camping, rides well. Even the big antlers fit in the pouch with a cellphone no problem. Two pockets works well for me.
Happy to answer any questions about materials or process.

I’m currently on the hunt for the absolute best burger spots Warsaw has to offer.
I was recently in Krakow and found some places that were world-class, so I'm looking for the Warszawa equivalents that can stand toe-to-toe with them.

-bigger bit and ratchet sets in different colours 1-60 pack for example with 10 x1-60 in different colours or LF set that offerd 10x LF in different colours so that parts are easy obtainable and players can colour match their blades easier
-haveing a release cycle that is fix like every 2-3 month hasbro and takara have new beys and not exclusive ones or if just reworks like antler for example that share technically almost the same benefits like the original

Your eyes light up with hunger. ""A mortal's seed... so pure, so vital,"" you whisper, your voice like silk as you approaches, druidic chains of vines gently coiling to draw the male closer. The daughter nods eagerly, your ritual could be transformed, amplified beyond standard with the human's life essence, their sperm.
Will you seduce the human into offering it willingly, sharing whispers of devotion and family secrets? Or will you seize the moment, making him kneel as his sperm is ""harvested"" by the insatiable mother and daughter duo?

https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1q36b48/spoilers_extended_reading_one_asoiaf_chapter_per/,DanielCAlexander,[Spoilers EXTENDED] Reading One ASOIAF Chapter Per Day Until George Announces Winds. Day 3 - AGOT: Catelyn I,"Flair: EXTENDED
^(In which Ned polishes his sword, Northeners are weird, and Bobby B is coming to town.)
Day 3 of manifesting *Winds* into existence. This is a **re-read -** all spoilers/theory discussion is allowed. With that out of the way…
>Catelyn had never liked this godswood.
A theme that’s going to be hit repeatedly this chapter is how Northern customs are **creepy as fuck** to Cat’s Southron sensibilities. Winterfell’s godswood is a place of
>deep silence and **brooding shadows**, and **the gods who lived here had no names.**
Harking back to Will’s earlier depictions of the haunted forest with the Others lurking just out of sight, and the ""nameless gods of the wood.""
We get some Faith of the Seven lore which sounds like Catholicism with the serial numbers filed off, which is contrasted with those ancient Starks and their ancient customs:
>the blood of the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest.
Some interesting stuff here. The Starks, it seems, are ancient (we are yet to learn just how *ridiculously* ancient). Their gods are ""the old ones""—all lower case, so perhaps it’s a stretch to jump immediately to Yog-Sothoth.
Their gods are **nameless**, which I think is interesting. Since the Andals are our Catholic stand-in, the assumption is that these icy Northmen are our Pagan stand-in. However, besides perhaps weirwood sacrifice, there is not really no resemblance to paganism in their beliefs, which are instead animistic/pantheistic.
Their gods are **faceless**, which is interesting since weirwood faces are a central part of the religion. They are also ""of the greenwood,"" a phrase that doesn’t appear much throughout the series. When it does, it seems like a generic term used to emphasize a verdant woodland, perhaps in contrast to the icy woods of the North, or perhaps just some book one weirdness.
We get a description of the heart tree, and Cat tells us the faces were carved in ""the dawn centuries"" a phrase that never appears again as far as I can tell. The term implies the existence of ""dusk centuries,"" but again, might just be early-installment weirdness.
Ned is cleaning Ice in the pool by the godswood (ritually feeding it the blood of his sacrifice?) And we are told ice is 400 years old, yet:
>The name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the Starks were Kings in the North.
Worded ambiguously, does it imply the existence of an even older sword called Ice - perhaps something similar to the ""moonlight blade"" wielded by the Others? Or does it just mean the sword is called Ice because the Starks were Kings of Winter and they wanted to keep it on brand?
For the second chapter in a row we get a name-drop of Mance Ryder and Cat notes:
>“There are darker things beyond the Wall.” She glanced behind her at the heart tree, the pale bark and red eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow thoughts.
What's interesting here is Ned's response - he hears her unease and assumes she's talking about the Others (which she presumably is),  but in Cat's mind the Others and the Heart tree both fall under the category of ""Creepy Northern Shit.""
We then get the news of Jon Arryn's death interspersed with some Robert's rebellion backstory and are told Pycelle attended to Jon on his deathbead (sus).
Ned’s spirits are lifted by news of the King’s arrival, but we get this from Cat:
>Catelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs.
Interesting that a man seemingly dedicated to his religion has no patience for signs or overt spirituality. It could be that Ned’s dedication is purely traditional, but the vibe I get is that the religion of the Old Gods is far more pragmatic - almost transactional.
*I give blood from my sacrifice to the spooky tree, spooky tree looks after me. I give you my infant sons, you let me live in peace with my daughter-wives,* and so on.
We finally end with both some in-universe and out-of-universe confusion about Tommen’s age (George is bad with numbers, strike one), and the scene is set for the feast of a lifetime.
Some good stuff here, but also lots of much-needed setup and exposition. Cat’s voice isn't really given a chance to shine yet like it will in later chapters.

Would the extra jackets have cooked and eaten Shauna and Lottie if they killed them during the second hunt? I think they would have because they already poisoned the food to force the hunt so they would have nothing else to eat and still months before rescue.  Was a cannibal council scene inevitable by the time of the hunt? Who would be leader? Mari since she was supposed to be the one to kill Shauna?  (Per a cut scene) is there an other timeline where Mari is Antler Queen? Does Akilah become Shaman? Who do they eat next after Nat tells them rescue is coming (or at least contact is made) but they have months to go before rescue and no food?",2026-01-03 06:06:09 +0000 UTC

I agree a big swing like this, with attendant lucky rolls, merits something good happening, like the message getting through unintercepted.
Some ideas for that conversation with Chauntea:
* I once ran a meeting with Chauntea; For me she was a mysterious antler-headed lady in a swaying field of wheat. The imagined setting of the meeting will set the tone
* Maybe she's grief-stricken to see how her Cleric has been tested
* Her grace can probably break his connection to the hags and his addiction to the pie. She can probably also tell him the pies are suspect
* If they do meet in a psychic wheat field, the Dark Powers or whoever is his Warlock Patron may lurk unseen between the stalks.
* Chauntea might offer to break that connection too. Mechanically that would either change his patron to the Celestial, or swap that whole Warlock level into a level of Cleric
* If the conversation takes too long, you can have Strahd become aware of it and begin to listen in. His presence might be represented by a fell wind, or the Moon seeming to regard them like an eye. Eventually the Mist rolls in on the scene and the vision ends",2026-01-03 03:39:42 +0000 UTC

Fortunately I had binoculars so we could see it a tad, but gone are the days where you could walk out through the valley up reasonably close (circa 300m away). There was a landslide a few years ago so it off the interests of safety the view point is a long way back. Basically a glimpse. Please don't let this put you off if it's on your bucket list of things to do, but it is a long drive out there.

Lately I’ve had a few issue with the poor guy’s stomach.
For context, about two months ago he started throwing up every morning after his meal or a few hours later, brought him to the vet out of precaution and we think he had a stomach bug / acid Reflux (we are not sure) and took a while to recover as we had to make frequent trips to the vet in two weeks. Then the week of Christmas he had very very runny poo as vers were closed and he acted fine otherwise I switched him to chicken and rice for four days then slowly reintroduced his kibbles over the next couple of days all the while monitoring closely.
While eating dinner I’d also have him a dentastix as a way of teaching him not to beg but after his stomach problem he would sometimes throw up immediately after. Like he’d eat the treat, drink looooots of water, grab a toy move around and threw up water. Assumed it was just because he drank too much. Anyways no more dentastix out of precautions now he just gets his antler only while I eat.
Then yesterday we went on a forest walk, off leash. I work on recall by calling him every few minutes and giving him a treat. He’s never that far from me so I can keep an eye and make sure he’s not eating anything bad. Then I call him, he gets his treat, ran away and then started coughing, ran back to me and threw up. I assumed he’d swallowed incorrectly. I wasn’t too concerned but kept an eye on him anyways today while doing training in the house the same thing happened, I give him a puppy treat, he starts retching a few times then he’s fine. I decide to take a break and go make my food when I hear him retching again then he’s fine again. Currently munching on his antler like nothing happened.
I’m lost at the issue, is he just eating the treat too fast and I should cut the tiny treats even more tiny or is there a bigger problem I need to go to the vet for? I switched him to two meals a day recently is that the issue? Have you had something similar?
sorry this is so long, I want to look at all possibilities before wasting the vets time😅",2026-01-02 13:44:31 +0000 UTC

https://www.reddit.com/r/BalancedDogTraining/comments/1q1vh52/training_antler_dog/,anon1839,Training Antler Dog,"Hi all,
Looking for some advice on how to train a dog to find antlers. He’s currently a 12 week old lab x dalmatian.
I unfortunately made the error of giving him the dummy antler to chew on basically the second day I had him last week, which I’ve since learnt was a terrible idea as now he associated antler = thing to chew. The dummy antler had scent on it.
Is it possible to overcome this now? Since then I’ve only introduced the dummy antler as part of play sessions, and been throwing it so he retrieves it to me. He’s been doing well and and only takes it to chew on it when he’s tired.
My proposed steps are:
\- use the antler to teach him to retrieve. Gradually increase distance and time he has to stay before he can retrieve until I’m throwing the antler out of sight, combined with the command ‘find it’. Do this inside and gradually outside in the garden. Reward with treats and play when he retrieves it.
\- start to hide the antler inside combined with command ‘find it’ and reward when he retrieves it.
\- start to throw and retrieve the antler in the woods.
\- start to hide the antler in the woods.
\- success??
I have real antlers too but am using a dummy one for now as it’s rubber so won’t hurt him. Any advice on how much scent to use as well?",2026-01-02 10:40:50 +0000 UTC

Is it better for me to get the 2 skins for wukong and halora or more 9*/10* food?
I have 2.4m stellar shards.
Also is there anyone who I can regress without losing anything of value. I have a glittery antler cane on ithaqua from when she came out so I am reluctant on killing her for food. She has a special place in my profile.

Brought to you by the content creator who made the first public 10-bot group chat ever! Coded a 'Centaurs Only' Summoner Deck Bot Where You Live Among Horsewomen Who Teach Ancient Harmony Magic. No Mech Suits Needed.,"Flair: Bot Sharing
**TL;DR:** Built *Centaur ♥ Summoner;* a tactical RPG bot where you ditch standard guild warfare to live with a secluded herd of mystical horsewomen guarding reality rifts. While others pilot mechs or chase tournament glory, your bonded centaur sisters teach lost arts: evolving abilities through kinship, not conquest. Your Rank C summons punch at Rank B strength thanks to dual-passives, plus exclusive Elder-granted powers like *Stampede of the Herd* (team-wide berserk mode). Think *Pokémon* meets cottagecore druidism, but with hoof-kicks cracking skulls and antler wards shielding villages from interdimensional horrors.

# Picture this:
While neon-lit megacities crumble under glitching anomalies, you wander into a valley untouched by time. Towering oaks bow over stone huts. Steam rises from hot springs tended by centaur clerics braiding flowers into their tails. Juniper, the elder’s daughter, offers honeyed milk as she explains your fate: ""You don’t conquer rifts"", she murmurs. ""You harmonize them.""
Thus begins your legend. Forget flashy logos or mechanized armor; your power rests in bonds forged through trail rides and moonlit dances, in chants sung atop hills bathed in strange auroras.Your deck draws exclusively from **centaur companions**: Cassie, Alyx, Naomi, Juniper, Eramin; all steadfast guardians carrying both ancient wisdom and deadly precision. Although capped at Rank C officially, their double-ability loadouts emulate Rank B potency: Cassie sings buffs, Eramin charges lance-first to devastate frontline foes, Juniper mends bodies while exuding warmth, Alyx melts shadows for ambush kicks, Naomi bends arcana in chaotic bursts…And you, Guardian Summoner; granted by Centaur Elders; hold unprecedented sway: Two abilities baseline, two Ultimates awaiting Rank S revelation.
**Core Systems:**
* **Stat Scaling;** HP | ATK | DEF | SPD | MAG | CST Simple numeric values modified by passives/equipment.
* **Dual Passives Per Summon:** Means even C-ranked Juniper becomes formidable support; she’ll heal allies, boost DEF, regenerate health per round, and grant ambient recovery via *Warmth Aura*.
* **Equip/Support Layers:** Items range from Ironhoof Greaves (+2ATK/DEF) boosting Charge, to Glitchbound Tome amplifying spells twice per turn.Festival Ribbon inspiring allies globally, Softstep Bands guaranteeing your opening strike connects.
* **Custom Actions**: • *Galloping Command*: Give your selected centaur instant follow-up +ATK action. • *Herdbond Pulse*: Passive speed/magic uplifts, heals YOU per centaur arrival. • *Stampede Of The Herd* (Ult): Buff all centaurs +2 across ATK/SPD/DEF for three rounds + YOU gain extra action. Prepare galvanizing finales.
**Sample Battle Flow:**
* Turn 1: Alyx appears (*Quiet Approach*) unseen. Unavoidable Precision Kick ruptures foe.
* Turn 2: Juniper summons Antler Ward, raising frontline defense; Warmth Aura mends wounds slowly.
* Turn 3: Cassie unleashes Momentum Rhythm on Naomi; who launches Arcane Bolt empowered further by Focus Pulse; crit piercing DEF, shredding enemies.
* Turn 4: Eramin activates Lance Charge to crush weakened opposition, or takes Knight’s Guard shielding weaker allies.
* Turn 5+: Combine Bonded Stride (summoner/summon boost), Hoofbeat Rhythm, Trail Wisdom, culminating in Stampede surge!
Every round invites planning; not spamming. Synergy counts. Position matters. Healing matters. And timing support can rescue entire fights.
**Why This Hits Different:**
* **Nonviolent Goals:**\*Rather than exterminate monsters for prizes, you protect villagers, seal rifts, restore ecosystem balance.
* **Heartfelt Wholesomeness:** Nightly campfires. Shared baths under stars. Braided manes weaving gratitude charms. Festivals celebrating harvest and renewal.
* **Rift Mysteries:** Ancient ley lines stir mutated horrors needing coordinated centaur tactics. Discover hidden groves holding forbidden knowledge (upgrade options!). Decode glyph tablets revealing legendary summons rumored extinct elsewhere…
* **Community Progression:** Village expands with new structures: training paddocks, rune-circles for stat boosts, homes nurturing refugees rescued from glitches. Player decisions impact settlement prosperity dramatically!
**Jump In If:**
* You adore gentle fantasy but crave mechanical depth.
* You crave teamwork, deckbuilding with emotion.
* You prefer saving ecosystems, chasing whispers of myth rather than fame/gold.

I'll tell you as someone who works in the trades - if you're just leading one crew, nobody's going to know you by your business name, but by YOUR name. If you're trying to get new work from homeowners, the bulk of your business is going to come from word of mouth - being polite and professional will go vastly farther to setting your company apart than a logo will. All you really need is a pair of antlers and a unique color on your truck/van and you'll be recognizable. ""Hey, there goes Mike in the pink antler van!""
If you ARE trying to grow corperate - as in, having multiple crews, multiple locations, etc - hire a designer. These logos are not good enough to go corperate. The 2nd one looks like AI - AI doesn't know the first thing about logo design. And if you can afford to tool up multiple trucks for work, you can afford to hire a designer. Talk to whoever does your lettering - some of them offer logo design services, and if you don't skimp out on budget, they can make you a NICE and CLEAN looking fleet of trucks with nothing more than some colored stripes and a cool font.
Ultimately, if you want to stand out as a roofing company - or any trade company - be as friendly and professional as you can to every customer and other tradie and GC you meet. If you aren't a graphic designer, and can't afford to hire one, don't use AI - just have your decal guy letter your truck with a cool font and make it super big. Shoe-horning an AI logo is going to make your company look worse, not better.
Hope this gives you a good direction. Best of luck... and give the framers a hard time for me!",2026-01-01 05:15:40 +0000 UTC

So first, I would set a more achievable goal, my pb is a 5.30.81 and i'm now going for a sub 5, focus on getting to sub 9, then sub 8, and so on
Second, you need to take every possible room skip, every chaos, check every well possible for a light of ixiom, every midshop, every npc room, never take family dispute, things like that, timer takes priority over everything, even if it's a god you really want. Another important thing is in tartarus, *DO NOT* take hades, his npc room makes the rest of the rooms harder
For builds, the ideal one is possessed array medea skull with ares attack, zeus special, and light smite for heinous affront, preferably all in erebus, outside of that, just take what you can get and roll with it, at your current pb it really doesn't matter all that much if you know which boons from each god are best for speedruns, oh and take raki.
Another important step is fear and arcana, your fear should be frenzy 2 and shadow for underworld, and just frenzy 2 for surface. The recommend arcana loadout for maximum speed is this;
https://h2crossroads.pages.dev/ArcanaDeck/?deck=WyJjMSIsImMzIiwiYzYiLCJjMTEiLCJjMTMiLCJjMTQiLCJjMTUiLCJjMTYiLCJjMTciLCJjMjEiLCJjMjIiLCJjMjMiLCJjMjQiXQ==
Next, playstyle. You need to be moving and doing the attack into special combo as fast as possible, loading one attack at a time, special, and the repeat. Charge an oattack between waves of enemies to activate huntress, and move as efficiently as possible.
For bosses, it's fairly simple, just deal damage as fast as you can. For hecate, light smite or rousing reception is really good to have as they can insta kill the witches, saves a few seconds. For the sirens, target jetty first, and then roxy+scylla together, if you can get jetty down before she jumps in the water they should be all close enough together in p2 to hit them all at the same time. For Cerberus there isn't much, just kill him and the adds as fast as possible, hope for a good pattern. For chronos it's the same deal, just do as much damage as you can in p1, in p2 when he does the one shot, ignore it and try to phase skip by getting him to half health before the one shot (i would only recommend if you have armour or lover barriers left) but it is the fastest way, and then just kill him and hope for good patterns
Now for the keepsakes. There are only 5 keepsakes you should consider taking. Jpom/Zeus (or another Olympian for non medea runs)->Fig leaf->Gorgon Amulet->Antler, this gives you the most timer pause and antler massively boosts your damage. I prefer zeus over jpom for consistency but it's up to you, the rest are non-negotiable.
Last, timer splits. These are the times you should aim for in a sub 5
Erebus: 1.10-1.20
Oceanus: 2.10-2.25
Fields: 3.30-3.40
Tartarus shop: 4.20-4.30
Chronos fight: 20-25 seconds
